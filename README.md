### What is EasyLOB?

EasyLOB is a Data-Driven Design Archetype for developing Web based .NET Line of Business (LOB) Applications. An Archetype is a set of Libraries, Design Patterns, Design Practices, Code Generation Scripts and Guidelines. The goal is to build LOB Applications without worrying about "code plumbing": let EasyLOB take care of most of it for you and leave more time to worry about the real Business problems.

### Versions & GitHub Repositories

The latest EasyLOB is [EasyLOB 4](https://github.com/EasyLOB/EasyLOB-4), below you find a comparison with older versions. Documentation is under-construction, but older EasyLOB Wikis are a good source of information.

### What kind of problems does EasyLOB solve?

EasyLOB is usefull as a platform for building LOB Application much faster than trying to do all the "plumbing code" by yourself. There are many different scenarios where it could be very usefull:

* If you are a **Single Programmer** selling development services, you will be able to enhance your productivity, building better programas, faster, and getting more projects/clients.
* If you are a **Company** with a small team of Programmers, you will be able to define a development Archetype to be followed. Besides having the same advantages of the Single Programmer, you are protected against future changes in your team. If someone leaves, the knowledge about your applications wonÂ´t leave with him/her, as anyone with knowledge about EasyLOB will be able to keep your applications working.
* If you are an **Experienced User** in some Business Field with some programming skills and want to create a .NET application for new a Business opportunity, you may use EasyLOB as the foundation of your application.
* If you are a **Student** trying to start with .NET, EasyLOB is a nice example of many libraries, patterns and practices widely used with .NET Framework.
* If you are a **Geek** curious about how many different Microsoft and Third Party technologies work together, EasyLOB is a nice real world example.

I made my best efforts to reference every significant piece of code from someone else I used in EasyLOB. If you find any code that is yours and I did not reference, please let me know and I will reference it correctly immediately.

Thank you very much for giving me the tools to create EasyLOB :clap:
